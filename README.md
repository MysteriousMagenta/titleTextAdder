A simply utility that adds the text that appears when hover over an image.
# Why?
I read xkcd often and it was just boring to have to hover over every single image in the what-ifs, etc.
So I thought of making this. And I did.
# Extra Options
I have an xkcd option that puts it before the image rather than after if you're on xkcd. To disable this, simply set XKCDExtra to False
